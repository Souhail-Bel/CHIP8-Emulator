# CHIP-8 Emulator âš¡
This is a simple CHIP8 emulator made in C.
## Running the emulator ðŸš€
Simply `make`.
If you want to enable debug mode, simply `make debug=1`.

Afterwards, you can either directly run the emulator or specify a ROM to load as an argument.

    ./bin/chip8emu [PATH_TO_ROM]

## Chip specifications
* 4KB Memory (Program starts at 0x200)
* 2-byte program counter
* 2-byte I register
* 16 1-byte V registers
* 2-byte stack array
* Sound and delay timers
* 64x32 display
* Hex keyboard
* beep.

## Code structure
* Debug print triggered by **DEBUG_MODE** flag upon compilation
* Multiple possible message outputs: Error, Warning, Information
* Memory is dumped upon quitting for better diagnostics

The **ROM** is read through the argument passed during execution, though if none is given, it reverts back to the test featured on https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom.

A **fetch-execute** cycle is included with the speed under the hypothesis that the microprocessor runs at 700Hz, relying on `usleep(TIME IN MICROSECONDS)` from `unistd.h` library.

The OP code execution is done by referring to a LUT based on function pointers.
Having each OP code be a function is useful for debugging.

**SDL2** is used for display and to handle input, which is mapped, similar to the hex keypad layout in RCA Cosmac VIP, as such:
| | | | |->|||||
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|1|2|3|C|->|1|2|3|4|
|4|5|6|D|->|A|Z|E|R|
|7|8|9|E|->|Q|S|D|F|
|A|0|B|F|->|W|X|C|V|
